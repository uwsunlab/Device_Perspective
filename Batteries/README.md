# Batteries
This section contains Python code for lifetime prediction of batteries using the data base from the paper "Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation". The data base can be downloaded from https://s3.amazonaws.com/publications.matr.io/1/final_data/FastCharge.zip. It is recommended to run the notebook "full_data_prediction_som.ipynb" first, then "full_data_prediction_features.ipynb". To run the code properly, please unzip the downloaded file "FastCharge.zip" and put the folder "FastCharge" in the same path as the notebooks.
